A rails plugin providing templating abilities for generating pdf files leveraging the new kick-ass prawn library (http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/)

Full documentation/demos at: http://cracklabs.com/prawnto (slightly out of date)

This is my attempt to merge the various forks of the prawnto gem, and <b>update it for Rails 3.1</b>. I want to thank the many developers who's code I collected together for the gem.

<b>Note:</b> It has not been tested with earlier versions of Rails.

== Installation in Rails 3.1

In your <code>Gemfile</code>:

  gem 'prawnto', :git => "git://github.com/forrest/prawnto.git"
  
== Usage

On it's way...
