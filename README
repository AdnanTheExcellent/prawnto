prawn_view was created by thorny_sun from cracklabs.com
git://github.com/thorny-sun/prawn_view.git
standing on the shoulders of giants:

as a starting point I used the updated railspdf plugin:
git://github.com/pelargir/railspdf.git
more specifically:
http://github.com/pelargir/railspdf/commit/70c172d21c0021de670eda564aea6902c60ef683
written by:
pelargir (Mathew Bass)

pelargir's was a 2.1 update to the original railspdf plugin at: 
http://rubyforge.org/projects/railspdfplugin/
written by:
Tom Willett & Josh Charles

which was based on the info on the rails wiki regarding pdfs:
http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtoGeneratePDFs
which I believe was written by the original author of the 
pdf-writer gem:
Austin Ziegler

i've also used the xml builder template code to deduce
how to use the latest rails 2.1 goodness.
so thanks to those authors for the example as well as the framework:
lifo? NKoz? jeremy? josh?

and of course a huge thanks to the man behind prawn:
sandal (Gregory Brown)
i am but a prawn parasite (hopefully symbiotic)



instructions: (for rails >=2.1)
-------------------------------------------------
 1) link in prawn lib:
      - if gem by now, then:
          gem install prawn
      - if not gem yet or you want latest, then: 
          (assumes you're using git and know about submodules)
          git submodule add git://github.com:sandal/prawn.git vendor/gems/prawn-0.0.0.1/

 2) set up gem dependency:
      - in environment.rb add this line at appropriate place:
          config.gem "prawn"
      (ideally the plugin should register this dependency on its own, 
       but i couldn't figure out how-- anyone know please tell me --
       init.rb seems to be too late in initialization process to work)

 3) create your view:
      - end your view file with .pdf.prawn extention.  
      - the view will have access to a local 'pdf' variable that 
          is the Prawn::Document object.

 4) setup options:
      - if you'd like to set any of the Prawn::Document initial setup
          options, then you will have to set them up in the controller
          using the @prawn_document_options hash.
          i.e.  @prawn_document_options = {:page_layout=>:landscape}
      (ideally this view stuff would be specified in the view-- any
       ideas how to get it there? Trying to get prawn author to 
       provide hooks for initial option setup from Document object,
       which might solve this.)
      - an additional option of :filename is afforded in the case that
          the user would like to provide a filename for the pdf.  though 
          this option also futzes with inline vs. download flag-- need to
          break this out as separate flag
