prawn_view

credits/acknowledgments:
this was completely ripped off from pelagir's railspdf plugin: 
which is completely ripped off of the original railspdf plugin:
which is completely ripped off of the rails wiki regarding pdfs:

instructions:
 1) link in prawn lib:
      - if gem by now, then:
          gem install prawn
      - if not gem yet or you want latest, then:
          git submodule add git://github.com:sandal/prawn.git vendor/gems/prawn-0.0.0.1/

 2) set up gem dependency:
      - in environment.rb add this line at appropriate place:
          config.gem "prawn"
      (ideally the plugin should register this dependency on its own, 
       but i couldn't figure out how-- anyone know please tell me)

 3) make a view with .prawn extention
 4) inside view just use prawn functions

options:
  if you want to set up any of the options available to Prawn::Document
  then simply add this line before anything else:
    options = :page_size=>:landscape, etc., etc.
  
  made this change from railspdf to keep formatting decisions inside the view


possibly relevant bits from old railspdf:

To begin rendering PDFs, simply create a view with a .rpdf extension and paste in the code:

  pdf.select_font "Times-Roman"
  pdf.text "Hello, World", :font_size => 72, :justification => :center

If you want the text to be dynamic, simply replace "Hello World" with an instance variable. It works like a charm, although I had to rearrange the code a bit to make it work. (See the sample controller code at the bottom.)

I've not yet tested any of this; I was just too excited once it started working. Note: to get plugins to work properly, you MUST restart the server after installing it.

  **Important** If you are using a layout, you must disable it for the view!!! 

The default filename for the pdf is "Default.pdf" I'll probably change that later to reflect the view name, but for now it works pretty good. To override it, set an instance variable in your controller named "@rails_pdf_name" The rendered pdf will take this filename.

Please let me know if you have any questions.


Sample Controller
-----------------

  class PagesController < ApplicationController
    def getpdf
    	@rails_pdf_name = "Hello.pdf"
    	@content = "This is dynamic content!!!"
    end
  end


Sample View
-----------

  pdf.select_font "Times-Roman"
  pdf.text @content, :font_size => 72, :justification => :center
